**What is DeFi?**

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance.

It’s basically a term for traditional— and not-so-traditional— financial products and services re-imagined for a crypto-native world. It’s a critical piece of building a truly Open Web.

**Why is DeFi so revolutionary?**

To start, anyone with Internet connection can participate in DeFi. There are no centralized authorities who can deny you access to anything (e.g. a loan, a bank account, access to your own funds).
