_Ethereum was created in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin to let anyone “write smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).” [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/))_

_To understand what that even means, let’s define the following:_

![ethereum definitions]()

1. Ether is Ethereum’s digital token. Ether is a store of value like Bitcoin, but its main purpose is to reward nodes on the ethereum blockchain for processing transactions.
2. Gas is the amount of Ether that’s paid to a node to process a transaction. 
3. Smart contracts are code that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This code is:
    1. Decentralized: Stored across all nodes in the network.
    2. Immutable: Can’t be changed once committed to the blockchain.
    3. Open: Anyone can view the code and use it (like an open API).
4. Decentralized apps (dapp) combine a backend smart contract with frontend UI.

_Dapps are where the action is in crypto and the majority are built on Ethereum. Examples include:_

1. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) for buying and selling digital assets.
2. [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?utm_source=StateOfTheDApps) for swapping digital tokens.
3. [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) for owning land in a 3D digital world.

_All of these dapps cost gas to run. That’s why Ethereum is upgrading to '[eth 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)' (which includes shifting from proof of work to stake) to scale the network, reduce energy consumption, and lower gas fees._
