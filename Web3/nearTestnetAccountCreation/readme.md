**Secure your account**

_Choose your account recovery method. "Secure Passphrase" or Ledger is recommended as the most secure method._

**Secure Passphrase**

_When selecting a Secure Passphrase / [seed phrase](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase) it is extremely important to write down your words IN ORDER and keep them in a safe place! NEAR Team will not be able to help you recover your account without it._

E-mail
_When choosing e-mail, a ONE TIME recovery link will be sent to you that will have a recovery seed phrase embedded in the URL._
