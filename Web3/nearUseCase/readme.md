# NEAR Use Case

These contents have been prepared using online resources. Patika.dev’s own contents are currently under preparation.

_Guest Book is a smart contract build on top of NEAR Protocol. It is a simple smart contract that allows you to add a message and donation (optional). It is built by using AssemblyScript on the contract side, and React on the frontend._

_Let’s take a look at this smart contract and see how it is very similar compared to any other application that is built on Web 2.0._
