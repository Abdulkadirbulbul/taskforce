When you hear people talking about crypto, you likely hear the term "Web3" being thrown around.

## **What exactly is Web3 & what makes it so special?**

To best answer this question, we first have to establish what Web1 & Web2 are.

TLDR;

- **Web1** - past version of the Internet
- **Web2** - version of the Internet that most of us know today (dominated by tech giants)
- **Web3**- the next phase of the Internet, pioneered by crypto & currently being built

💡 **Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.**

"Web3 refers to a potential new iteration of the internet that runs on public blockchains, the record-keeping technology best known for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. The appeal of Web3 is that it is decentralized, so that instead of users accessing the internet through services mediated by the likes of Google, Apple, or Facebook, it’s the individuals themselves who own and control pieces of the internet. Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities don’t dictate who uses what services, nor is there a need for “trust,” referring to the idea that an intermediary does not need to facilitate virtual transactions between two or more parties. Web3 theoretically protects user privacy better as well, because it’s these authorities and intermediaries that are doing most of the data collection." - [Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2021/11/web3-explained-crypto-nfts-bored-apes.html)
