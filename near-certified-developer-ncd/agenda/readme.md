# AGENDA

The bootcamp agenda will proceed as follows. First you will see NEAR tools and how to use AssemblyScript in NEAR. Second, we will learn about NEAR specific concepts. Finally, we will review the projects developed with NEAR. Then we will expect you to develop your projects.

- Familiarize yourself with NEAR Tools and AssemblyScript
- Familiarize yourself with NEAR specific concepts
- Examples and your project

So please, for the rest of the bootcamp â€¦

- DO NOT wait until you understand everything,  FOCUS on trying to make something simple
- DO NOT dive into consensus and economics, FOCUS on trying to study working examples
- DO NOT insist on learning to write Rust, FOCUS on using the best language for YOU
- DO NOT add complexity with frontend code, FOCUS on writing contract code
