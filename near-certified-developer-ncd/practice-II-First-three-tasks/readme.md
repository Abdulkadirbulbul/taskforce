# Practice 

You need to practice what we learned until now. Practicing is a vital element of becoming a NEAR developer. In this part, we have a smart contract which was created by the NEAR education team. We want to clone this repository and make changes as follows. This is the second time you make changes to a smart contract in our bootcamp.

`git clone https://github.com/Learn-NEAR/starter--near-sdk-as`
`yarn`
